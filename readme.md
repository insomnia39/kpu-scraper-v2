# kpu-scraper-v2
This is faster version of kpu-scraper. I got some limitations on Node Js, one of them can't handle so many Http connections at the same time. So i change to .net6 which i know it could handle those issue.

# How To
1. Build the project
2. Get the .exe file inside bin folder (kpu-scraper-v2.exe)
3. Copy those .exe file and index.js (main folder) to your folder
4. Run the .exe file to get vote data on that day
5. Run the index.js file (cmd: node index.js)
